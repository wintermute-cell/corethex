# corethex
.. is a website manager and generator.
It can manage and display your pages, and allow you to write your website in RUNE automatically generating the HTML structures for you.

## use cases
Corethex is made specifically to generate and maintain minimalist websites, optimized for text-only browsers but also with a simplistic, fully configurable style for modern browsers.

## structure
A corethex website is usually structured like a tree. Each page can either be a **branchpage**, *containing* other pages, or a *leafpage*, having no further encapsulation.
